      <h3>ISA Pay – Terms of Service</h3>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/04/2025</p>
      <p>Welcome to ISA Pay (“we,” “our,” or “us”). By using ISA Pay, you (“customer” or “merchant”) agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read carefully.</p>
      <h4>1. Payment Processing</h4>
      <p>ISA Pay provides a secure payment gateway for transactions between customers and merchants. Payments may be processed through third-party providers (such as DPO, PayPal, M-Pesa, Airtel Money) but will always be branded and managed under ISA Pay. By using ISA Pay, you authorize us to hold, transfer, and disburse funds in accordance with these Terms.</p>
      <h4>2. Fund Holding</h4>
      <p>All payments made through ISA Pay are held in escrow until the following conditions are met: The customer confirms receipt of the purchased item or service, OR a period of 72 hours after delivery lapses without a return request. Once either condition is satisfied, ISA Pay will release funds to the merchant’s designated account.</p>
      <h4>3. Returns and Refunds</h4>
      <p>Customers have a 72-hour return period starting from the time of delivery confirmation. If a return is initiated within this period: ISA Pay will refund the transaction amount to the customer’s ISA Pay Wallet, not directly to the original payment method. Wallet balances may be used for future purchases or withdrawn (subject to provider fees and processing times). After the 72-hour window expires, transactions are considered final and non-refundable, except where required by law.</p>
      <h4>4. ISA Pay Wallet</h4>
      <p>The ISA Pay Wallet is a virtual account where refunds and promotional credits are stored. Wallet balances cannot be transferred to another user and may only be withdrawn by the account holder using verified payment methods. ISA Pay is not a bank, and wallet balances do not accrue interest.</p>
      <h4>5. Merchant Obligations</h4>
      <p>Merchants must provide accurate item descriptions, delivery timelines, and support for returns. Merchants agree not to request direct payments outside ISA Pay. ISA Pay reserves the right to suspend or hold payouts if fraudulent activity, disputes, or regulatory concerns arise.</p>
      <h4>6. Customer Obligations</h4>
      <p>Customers must provide accurate contact, delivery, and payment information. Customers agree to confirm receipt of goods or services promptly upon delivery. Failure to confirm receipt may result in automatic release of funds to the merchant after the 72-hour period.</p>
      <h4>7. Dispute Resolution</h4>
      <p>Any disputes regarding transactions must first be raised through ISA Pay’s dispute resolution system. If unresolved, disputes may be escalated to the respective payment provider (DPO, M-Pesa, Airtel, PayPal). ISA Pay’s decision in a dispute will be final, subject to applicable laws.</p>
      <h4>8. Liability</h4>
      <p>ISA Pay acts as a payment intermediary and is not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of goods/services purchased. Our liability is limited to the amount of the transaction processed through ISA Pay.</p>
      <h4>9. Changes to Terms</h4>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of ISA Pay after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
