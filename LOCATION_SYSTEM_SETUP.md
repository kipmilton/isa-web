  accessToken: import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12', // Map style
  defaultCenter: [36.8219, -1.2921], // Default center (Nairobi)

   - Verify the token is valid in Mapbox dashboard

2. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Look for Mapbox-related errors in browser console
   - Ensure no CORS issues

### Location Not Working

1. **GPS Permissions**:
